		<p>
			We are a group of students from the Master’s in Applied Artificial Intelligence (MNA) program at Tecnológico de Monterrey.
			This webpage was developed with the purpose of providing a better service for data collection and classification to train Machine Learning models.
			Our ultimate goal is to create real-time tools that facilitate communication with individuals who have hearing disabilities.
			This platform also aims to expand the possibilities for interacting with people who have speech or communication impairments.
			You can contribute by uploading your own images or taking live pictures that replicate the signs displayed on the screen.
